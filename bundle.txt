This is a note mostly for my own reference, as a reminder of how to compile the app to create Windows and Mac OSX executables. 

cmonit March 2019.

NB the app makes use of Biopython and Pillow (aka PIL) libraries; these will need to be installed for bundling to work on either system

----------
MAC (must be on Mac system with py2app installed)

$ cd chroma_clade/
$ python2 setup.py py2app

This saves the resulting app bundle in the location specified in setup.py.

NB had problems when both scipy and matplotlib are installed in python2 when executing the above, because py2app automatically includes these and bloats the output bundle. Easily avoided by uninstalling these first:

$ pip2 uninstall scipy

However, in future better to use virtualenv or similar.
NB wise to change the version info in setup.py if appropriate.

I've found that it may be easier to distribute Mac app bundles if they are first compressed to give a single file, for example as .tgz. For this reason the repo does not track uncompressed .app

----------
WINDOWS (must be on windows system with pyinstaller installed)

> cd chroma_clade\src

Run the command given in chroma_clade/src/win_pyinstaller.txt.
Output .exe is saved in apps/windows.
