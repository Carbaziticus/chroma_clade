This is a note mostly for my own reference, as a reminder of how 
to compile the app to create Windows and macOS executables.

Updated August 2019.

NB the app makes use of Biopython and Pillow (aka PIL) libraries; 
these will need to be installed for bundling to work on either system.

Pyinstaller is used to build executables on both systems. Pyinstaller 
creates *.spec files with the same name as the app. Apparently *.spec 
files must be saved in the src/ directory; therefore to avoid conflict,
note that the macOS version is named ChromaClade.app while the windows
version is chroma_clade.exe.

----------
MAC (must be on Mac system with pyinstaller installed)

$ cd chroma_clade/
$ ./mac_pyinstaller.sh

This saves the resulting app bundle in apps/mac/.

Note that this script copies a tcl/tk file needed in the bundle.

----------
WINDOWS (must be on windows system with pyinstaller installed)

> cd chroma_clade\src

Run the command given in chroma_clade/src/win_pyinstaller.txt.
Output .exe is saved in apps/windows.
